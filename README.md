**take-a-break** is a small app for giving your eyes a break from time to time when working at a computer screen for long hours. It let's you set an interval which it fades the screen to black, reminding you to look away from the screen once in a while---preferably at something at a distance to give your eyes some diversion. 10 seconds of pause every ten minutes has been recommended somewhere, so that's the default.

There is only a Windows version at the moment (tested only on Windows 7).

Take care of your eyes :-)
